A small late-night project. I wanted to recreate the schematic in order to have a plug-and-play battery protection/charging and voltage regulation circuit for hardware development purposes, and ended up turning it into a PCB design exercise.
Based on the TP4056, it also includes the DW01A battery protection IC from Fortunate Semiconductor. 
A knockoff TP4056 and a genuine DW01A and FS8205 can all be purchased for very low prices, and these boards can be printed for next to nothing, too!

Thank you for checking out my repo.
